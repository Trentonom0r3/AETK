# Adobe After Effects Plugin Standard Library Toolkit (AETK)

Welcome to the Adobe After Effects Plugin Standard Library (AETK), a modern C++ framework designed to revolutionize the way developers create plugins for Adobe After Effects. Aimed at both newcomers and seasoned plugin developers, AETK provides an extensive suite of tools and abstractions that streamline the development process, enabling more focus on creativity and innovation.

## Features

- **Modern C++ Design**: Leveraging modern C++ features for a clean, robust, and efficient codebase.
- **Comprehensive Suite Handling**: Simplified interactions with After Effects' diverse suites, from item management to rendering.
- **Object-Oriented Approach**: AETK's design revolves around intuitive object-oriented principles, making plugin development more accessible and maintainable.
- **Efficient Asset Management**: Tools for importing, handling, and manipulating assets within After Effects projects.
- **Rendering and Composition**: Advanced support for rendering options, composition items, and layer management to create sophisticated visual effects.
- **Error Handling and Debugging**: Built-in mechanisms for error reporting and debugging to ensure stability and reliability.
- **Abstracted Plugin Design**: Use templated classes to structure your AEGP plugin in a more intuitive way, getting rid of the complex AE details.

## Getting Started

Dive into AETK with detailed documentation and examples to kickstart your plugin development. See docs [here](https://github.com/Trentonom0r3/AETK/blob/main/docs/AETK.pdf).

```cpp
#include "AETK/AEGP/AEGP.hpp"

// Example: Simplified access to After Effects functionalities
AE::App app;
app.Alert("Welcome to AETK!");
```

## Sample Projects

To help you get started with AETK, we've provided some sample projects that demonstrate the capabilities and best practices of AETK plugin development. These projects range from simple examples for beginners to more complex plugins for advanced users.
